    "Dealing with bias in estimtes of the lensign power spectrum represts a large body of continuing research.   Major types of Biases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   $N^{(0)}$ bias is the expectation value of the lensing power spectrum estimator that would be obtained if the CMB were an unlensed Gaussian field that had the power spectrum of the observed lensed CMB. \n",
    "1. $N^{(1)}$ bias arises from the correlations between gaussian noise and the reconstructed lensing map.\n",
    "1. $N^{(2)}$ bias arises from the correlations between non-gaussian noise and the reconstructed lensing map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributions to these biases can arrise from the noise properties of the instruemnt, instrumental such as systematics including beam assymetries, galactic foregrounds, ectra galacitc sources including AGN and SZ sources especially when correlated with large scale strucutres, and effects from masking portions of the galaxy or sources to remove foregorunds signals.    \n",
    "\n",
    "These effects can be mitigated through carful choice of estimators (bias hardened estimators, and cross-estimators) or removed through monte-carlo simulations.   These biases can be large, so dealing with these represntst the primary area of effort for prodcing cosmology from CMB lensing.  As the data go deeper, the required percisions for mitigating these effects must necissarly grow.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Excercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "choose and model one systematic effect.    Foregound masking and the inclusion of astrophysical sources are two easy opitons."
