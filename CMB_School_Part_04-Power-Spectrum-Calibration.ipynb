    "\n",
    "Before taking a 2d FFT (eg the obvious thing to do for computing a power spectrum) we must apodize the maps to eliminate edges effects.  Edge effects come about because the Fourier transform treats a square array as having periodic boundaries.  Thus if we take the Fourier transform of a 2-dimensional map and the values on the left and right side (and also, top and bottom) of the map don't match, we end up generating spurious signals.   In this example we use a cosine window to smoothly roll off the signal to zero as we approach the edges of the map.  There are many choices of windows that trade sensitivity loss, coupling of adjacent modes, and ringing."
