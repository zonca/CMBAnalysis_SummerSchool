    "Point sources in CMB maps arise from a number of astrophysical objects including active galactic nuclei (AGN), dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), and a bright tail of lensed DSFGs.  All of theses objects are interesting in their own right.  We will simulate sources in several bins of brightness from the two main families.  The way we simulate the sources, the number of sources in a given pixel of our simulated map will follow a Poisson distribution---i.e., there will be no angular clustering of the sources. For now we will just make a map that looks like data maps at 150 GHz.  If we were to make multifrequency maps, we would have to take into account the different frequency scalings of these families of sources.  In general DSFGs grow brighter at higher frequencies while AGN have a spectrum that falls with increasing frequencies.\n",

    "Clusters of galaxies imprint a subtle distortion into CMB maps that is most apparent on arcminute scales.    While clusters of galaxies are named after the galaxies bound within them, the galaxies represent only a small fraction of the matter contained within a cluster.   Roughly 80% of the baryons are not contained within galaxies, but rather exist as a cloud of gas bound within the gravitational potential well created by a dark matter halo that caries the vast majority of the mass of the cluster.  Within this well, the dilute gas becomes ionized and heated to temperatures of millions of Kelvin.  Occasionally a CMB photon interacts with one of the hot electrons in this ionized gas.  This interaction (inverse Compton scattering) gives the CMB photon a boost in energy.  Detailed calculations show that this effect (the Sunyev-Zeldovich or SZ effect) leads to decrement of power at frequencies below the 'null' at 220 GHz and extra power at higher frequencies.  This result is redshift independent.  Thus the SZ effect provides a clean way to detect clusters of galaxies and the signal which traces the electron density within the cluster.  The SZ signal is a reasonably good tracer of cluster mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these simulations we treat each cluster as having a brightness \"beta profile\", and fix each cluster to have an identical angular size.  We draw the distribution of central temperatures from an exponential distribution to simplify the code and reduce the dependance on external libraries.  For more accurate simulations, a range of clusters sizes should be used, a distribution of cluster shapes (with more accurate profiles) should be considered, and the number of clusters as a function of mass and redshift should be chosen to match measurements of the cluster mass function."
